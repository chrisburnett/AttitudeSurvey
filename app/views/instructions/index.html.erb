<h1>Health Information Privacy Survey</h1>

<p>This questionnaire is part of a large study (<a href="http://trump-india-uk.org">TRUMP</a>) funded by the <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/xrcprogrammes/Digital/Pages/home.aspx"</a>RCUK Digital Economy programme</a>. This study is a comparative study with India and is developing a support system for people living in rural areas who are suffering from chronic illnesses (such as diabetes, or depression) using mobile phone technology.</p>

<p>Part of the system requires the user to share information with a health care professional (e.g. their GP or practice nurse). We want to find out what type of information you are comfortable sharing, and who you would be willing to share it with, by completing our <strong>card sorting task</strong>. This is based on a <a href="#">paper version which has been previously used in the US</a>.</p>

<h4>How long will it take?</h4>
The tasks should take not longer than 15 minutes to complete.

<h4>What are the risks and benefits of taking part?</h4>
There are no risks involved in taking part. Your responses will help us to develop trustworthy personal health information systems.

<h4>Can I withdraw at any time?</h4>
Yes - if you wish to withdraw at any time after beginning, you can click the "withdraw" link at the top of each page, or simply navigate away from this website.

<h4>What happens to the information I provide?</h4>
<p>Your responses are completely confidential and cannot be linked to you. The University of Aberdeen complies with the Data Protection Act (1998) and all information will be treated with the strictest confidence. At the end of the survey, we would like to collect some basic demographic data. However, you can skip this step if you would rather not give us this information.</p>
